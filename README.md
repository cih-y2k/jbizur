### Bizur Cluster Examples

This repository contains some simple examples for running
your own bizur cluster.

**NB!** Examples are currently limited with only a three node
cluster where the nodes are initiated with pure java.

* **ThreeBizurNodeSetGet:** Initializes a 3 node cluster with
a client that will do a single set/get operation. No
*properties* file is used. The cluster is initiated with
pure java code.
